Capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

Purpose: Use data science to predict the possibility of being involved in a serious accident, given certain parameters such as the road conditions, weather conditions, light, etc.

Data: The data I will be using is is sourced from Kaggle, and uses multiple traffic APIs to collect accident data from February 2016 to June 2020 for the Contiguous United States. This data involves key attributes about each collision that is recorded, such as the severity code, location, junction type, road conditions, and weather conditions. The severity code changes from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating the least impact on traffic. This dataset also includes staticstics like the amount of time taken to clear up an accident site, which can help predict traffic conditions in the event of an accident. The independent attributes, such as the road and weather conditions, can be used to predict the severity code for a particular location/junction. Based on the severity code, users can plan their route to avoid areas with a high probability of being involved in a serious accident.
